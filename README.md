# simpleGame
Code given is a 2-player cricket game, where the CPU guesses the number and if the number entered and that of the CPU matches, then the player is OUT. The game ends when both the innings are over. 

Now I'll write out the steps to create a standalone python project: for which to run, you dont need any python dependencies.
1) Get the python package: pyinstaller

use pip command: pip install pyinstaller (if you are using anaconda, then the same command works)

2) Then in the terminal, enter into the directory where you have the program.

3) Next type the following command into the terminal:

pyinstaller <filename.py> 

4) You will have 2 more folders created (dist and build) inside the folder you are. 

5) Enter into the dist folder.

6) Find the application: the name will be the same as that of your python program.
